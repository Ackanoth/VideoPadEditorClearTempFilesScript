It is not recommended to try using this while you are editing a large video as it may slow 
everything down or cause you to lose video or audio in the export. I haven't tried it like 
that but it is one possibility. 

This is just meant to be an easier alternative to navigating to the hidden temp file directory 
and deleting hundreds of GB of temp files that have left your computer with no space left
